What is the karman to be experienced in this lifetime? It is that, the ripening of which ripens
in this lifetime, namely, that [karman] which comes from doing damage or benefit to someone
who has arisen from the concentration of benevolence.As [in the case of deeds which
one performs in order to do harm or benefit to someone arisen] from the concentration of benevolence,
and likewise to one arisen from the concentration without defilements, from the
meditative attainment of cessation, from the fruit of a stream enterer, [or] from the fruit
of an Arhat, and to the monastic community headed by the Buddha. Or, whatever wholesome
or wholesome [deeds] which one performs with a perception [accompanied by] a particularly
strong motivation (āśaya). [All those lead to results to be experienced in this lifetime.]What
is the karman that is to be experienced after rebirth? It is that, the ripening of
which ripens in the very next lifetime. For example, the karman that consists in the five
actions [that bring] immediate [retribution]. Or, again, other [kinds of] wholesome and unwholesome
[karman].What is the karman to be experienced in another lifetime? That, the ripening
of which ripens in a lifetime later than that [following lifetime].[Explanation by XUANZANG:
"Moreover [as for] the division of karman, there are four kinds, namely: black karman
with black ripening, white karman with white ripening, black and white karman with black
and white ripening. Not black [and] white karman without ripening which extinguishes all
karmas.]
