There are two kinds of bewilderment. Bewilderment with regard to the ripening of the fruit and
bewilderment with regard to true reality.For someone who is bewildered with regard to the
ripening of the fruit, demeritorious impulses come about. For someone who is bewildered
with regard to true reality, meritorious and immovable [impulses come about].
