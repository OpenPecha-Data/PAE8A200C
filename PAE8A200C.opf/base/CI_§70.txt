"Common karman" has been mentioned [in the sūtra], also "individual karman", as well as "strong
karman" and "weak karman".What is common karman? It is that which differentiates the receptacle
world.What is individual karman? It is that which differentiates the world of beings.And
there is also a [kind of] karman which consists in the mutual influence of beings,
on the basis of which it is said that beings influence [one another] mutually. Because that
being is not easily found who would not be delighted (upabhoga) by looking at one another
with another being and so on.What is strong karman? Any intentional unwholesome karman
[the result of which] is to be experienced in the hells [and which belongs to] a person in
whom the antidote is strong, is [then] to be experienced in this life because the antidote
gains strength. And [the result of unwholesome karman] which is to be experienced in this
life is not to be experienced [at all].Therefore, [in the case of such a person] the karman
of the antidote and [also] all intentional wholesome karman, [are] strong.Thinking of
this, the Sublime One said "[As for] the karman which has been done to a limited [extent]
by the Noble Hearer, whose mind is well-cultivated, limitless and vast: he is not lead by
that [karman], it does not stay with him, he will not be counted [as belonging to a specific
destination] through it.""Moreover the intentional unwholesome karman of a person in whom
the antidote is weak and [his] intentional karman which will certainly ripen – [provided
that it] has not been given up and has not been completely understood–that (i.e. those
two kinds of karman) is strong. That is intended [by the Sublime One] here."Moreover [four
are] strong by nature: unwholesome [karman] that is connected with the desire realm; and
also what has been done habitually before; [the karman that has been done when] standing on
[one’s] feet; and also [the karman] that cannot be cured, belonging to those who are [and
will be] without complete nirvana.Karman can be understood as being strong also from [the
point of view of its] field as well as from [the point of view of its] thought impulse.Moreover,
karman can also be understood as strong in terms of nine aspects. From [the point
of view of its] field, object, nature, basis, attention, disposition, companion, frequent
performance and connection with many people.Weak karman is [to be understood] as the opposite
of that.The Sublime One said: "If someone were to assert: ’In whichever way this person
has done and heaped up karman, in [exactly] that way will he experience [its] ripening,’
then one would not live the life of an ascetic (brahmacarya), and no occasion would be known
for the right extinction of suffering, for bringing an end to suffering".
