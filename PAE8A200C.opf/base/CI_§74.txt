giving to [an appropriate] vessel and giving by way of correctly distributing [the gifts]
to one’s kin and strangers.How is the perfection of the gift to be understood? The [gift

(/embezzlement), the object to be given [has not been acquired through] robbing it from
others, that the object to be given is not stinking and free from dirt, that the object
to be given is appropriate, the object to be given has been procured in accordance with
the Dharma.[Sūtra quotation, added by XUANZANG: "As the sūtra says: He is furnished with discipline.
He holds the Prātimokṣa restraints well. His manners and the places he goes are
all of integrity. When he sees a tiny sin, great dread arises. In all the subjects of training,
he takes [upon himself] the training well."]
