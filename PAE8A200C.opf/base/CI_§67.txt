There is [the case that] action entails a single existence through a single action. There is
[also the case that] action entails many existences through a single action. There is [also
the case that] action entails a single existence through many actions. There is [also the
case that] action entails many existences through one action.How does a living being that
is furnished with many karmas experience the fruit of [their] ripening successively?Here,
what is most heavy ripens first, or, what has become manifest at the time of death, or
that which has been [frequently] cultivated, or what has been done first will ripen as the
very first.[As for] what is said [in the sūtra]:"meritorious, demeritorious and immovable
action".What is meritorious? That which is wholesome, connected with the [realm of] desire.What
is demeritorious? That which is unwholesome.What is the immovable action? That which
is wholesome, connected with the [both] the material and immaterial realms.It has been said
[in the sūtra]: "ignorance is the condition of the impulses (saṃskārāḥ); [they are] meritorious,
demeritorious and immovable."How do meritorious, demeritorious and immovable impulses
come about with ignorance as [their] condition?
