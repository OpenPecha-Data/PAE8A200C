What is action (karman)? It is the action that is intention (cetanā) and the action after having
intended (cetayitvā). [That is] the condensed definition of action.Moreover, action is
also of five kinds: the action that is perception (upalabdhikarman), the action that is
efficacy (kāritrakarman), the action that is determination (vyavasāyakarman), the action that
is transformation (pariṇatikarman) and the action that is obtainment (prāptikarman).In
this context, however, the action that is determination is meant mainly.
