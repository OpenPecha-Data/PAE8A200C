impulse (cittābhisaṃskāra). It is meritorious, demeritorious, or [leading to] immovability.What
is the "action after having intended"? It is bodily, verbal and mental action.Moreover,
those actions of body, speech and mind are [either] wholesome (kuśala) or unwholesome
(akuśala).Unwholesome [actions] are the ten unwholesome paths of action (karmapatha), namely:
killing, taking what has not been given, sexual misconduct, lying, slander, harsh words,
idle prattle, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong view.Wholesome are the ten wholesome
paths of action, namely, abstaining from killing [etc.,] up to abstaining from idle prattle,
as well as absence of covetousness, absence of harmful intent and right view.The characteristics
of killing and so on are also to be understood from [the viewpoints of] object
(vastu), disposition (āśaya), preparation (prayoga), defilement (kleśa) and completion
(niṣṭhāgamana).[In the sūtras] "intentional action" has been mentioned. What is [that] intentionality
