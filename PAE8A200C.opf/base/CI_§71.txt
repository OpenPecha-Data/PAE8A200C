"But if someone were to assert: ’If a person has done and heaped up karman to be experienced
in such and such a way, he will experience [its] ripening to be experienced in such and such
a way’, then one would live the life of an ascetic, and an occasion would be known for
the right extinction of suffering, for bringing an end to suffering."Here, the Bhagavat has
rejected [the view that] karman associated with pleasure has a ripening which is [equally]
associated with pleasure.Likewise [the view that karman] associated with suffering, has
[a ripening that is equally] associated with suffering. And [the view that karman] that
is associated with neither suffering nor pleasure [has a ripening] that is associated with
neither suffering nor pleasure [are equally rejected].[The Sublime One] has however admitted
that [karman] associated with pleasure that is to be experienced as pleasure has a pleasant
ripening,that [this kind of karman associated with pleasure, if it is] to be experienced
as suffering, has a [ripening as] suffering,and that [this kind of karman associated
with pleasure, if it is] to be experienced as neither suffering nor pleasure, has neither
[its ripening as] suffering nor pleasure.[The Sublime One has likewise] admitted that [karman]
that is associated with suffering, if it is to be experienced as pleasure, has a pleasurable
ripening.that [this kind of karman associated with suffering if it is] to be experienced
as suffering has [a ripening] as suffering,that [this kind of karman associated with
suffering, if it is] to be experienced as neither suffering nor pleasure, has [a ripening
that is] neither suffering nor pleasure,[and] that [the karman] that is associated with
neither suffering nor pleasure to be experienced as pleasure has [a ripening as] pleasure
[is] admitted [by the Sublime One].[That this karman associated with neither suffering nor
pleasure, if it is] to be experienced as suffering, has [a ripening as] suffering,that [this
karman associated with neither suffering nor pleasure if it is] to be experienced as neither
suffering nor pleasure, has [a ripening as] neither suffering nor pleasure,that is
what is intended here [by the Sublime One].The classification of karman is (a.) karman that
is restraint, (b.) karman that is non-restraint, (c.) karman that is neither restraint,
nor non-restraint.What is the karman that is restraint? It is (a.) condensed in the prātimokṣa
restraints, (b.) condensed in the restraints of absorption and (c.) condensed in the
restraints without inflow.What is the karman condensed in the prātimokṣa restraints? There
are eight kinds: (1.) the restraints of a fully ordained monk, (2.) the restraints of a fully
ordained nun, (3.) the restraints of a trainee nun, (4.) the restraints of a novice monk,
(5.) the restraints of a novice nun, (6.) the restraints of a male lay follower, (7.)
the restraints of a female lay follower, 8.) the fasting restraints.
