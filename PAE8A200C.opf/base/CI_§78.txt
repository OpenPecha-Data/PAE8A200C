It has been said [in the sūtras] "the ripening of karman for the beings is unthinkable". How
is the ripening of karman thinkable? How is it unthinkable?That wholesome karman has a wanted
ripening among gods and humans is thinkable.That unwholesome karman has an unwanted ripening
in the miserable states, bad destinies, downfalls, [i.e. those of] hell beings, animals
and hungry spirits is thinkable.[To think that] "by this [specific] karman the variety
of bodies of beings comes about", this is [how] the [ripening of karman is] unthinkable.That
same wholesome and unwholesome karman is unthinkable from the point of view of its location,
object, cause and ripening.The karman that produces the various external phenomena
is unthinkable.The karman (i.e. efficacy) that is connected with jewels, mantras, medicine
and medical treatment (muṣṭiyoga) is unthinkable.All karman of the might of the Yogis is
unthinkable.The karman of control of the Bodhisattvas is unthinkable. It is as follows:Because
of control over [their] lifetime, control over [their] thought, control over utensils,
control over karman, control over birth, control over aspiration (adhimukti), control
over resolution (praṇidhāna), control over magical powers (ṛddhi), control over knowledge
(jñāna), control over the Dharma.[Addition by XUANZANG, see ASBh 73,14, above]The karman of
all the Buddhas to carry out the tasks of a Buddha is unthinkable.
