It is (1.) intentionality [due to] the command of others, (2.) intentionality [due to] the persuasion
of others, (3.) intentionality without having understood, (4.) intentionality [due
to] intense fixation [because of] the roots [of the unwholesome actions] and (5.) intentionality
[due to] a mistake.Here, [when] the karman of intentionality due to intense fixation
on the roots and the karman of intentionality due to a mistake are done and heaped up,

What is [that] "certainty"?
